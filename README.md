# moire-localization

This repository contains the code developed for [1], in the MATinMOL project
(<https://www.inesctec.pt/en/projects/matinmol>), funded by FCT
(https://www.fct.pt/).
The code is written in MATLAB and can be found in the `matlab` folder.
In that folder, the `run_thesis.m` script contains most of the examples
presented and analyzed in [1].
The code is mostly covered by the unit tests in the `matlab/tests` folder,
which can be run using the `run_tests.m` script.
